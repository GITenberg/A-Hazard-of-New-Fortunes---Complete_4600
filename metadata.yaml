description: "A Hazard of New Fortunes is a novel by William Dean Howells. Copyrighted\
  \ in 1889 and first published in the U.S. by Harper & Bros. in 1890, the book was\
  \ well-received for its portrayal of social injustice. Considered by many to be\
  \ his best work, the novel is also considered to be the first novel to portray New\
  \ York City. Some argue that the novel was the first of three Howells wrote with\
  \ Socialist and Utopian ideals in mind: The Quality of Mercy in 1892, and An Imperative\
  \ Duty in 1893. In this novel, although Howells briefly discusses the American Civil\
  \ War, he primarily deals with issues of post-war \"Gilded Age\" America, like labor\
  \ disputes, the rise of the self-made millionaire, the growth of urban America,\
  \ the influx of immigrants, and other industrial-era problems. Many critics consider\
  \ A Hazard of New Fortunes to be one of Howells' most important examples of American\
  \ literary Realism because he portrays a variety of people from different backgrounds.\n\
